"""Python Script to parse yarn logs to check of job success.

This python file extracts the status of a dataproc job from its job-id and then
uses this job-id to get the yarn application number.
The yarn application number enables it to read through the yarn logs to check
for the number iof records.
In case the number of records match that of BQ table it returns, in case of
mismatch, it throws an error.
